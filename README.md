# ASE – Lab #9
## Home Page
Started with the Tutorial 9 code. Rewrote the index.pug file to include the login form that included a button that would go to the /login route. The index.js file is how the program gets started and uses the index.pug to format the page. The /login route reads in the data from the form and writes it to the cookie before sending the user to the /cookiedata route.

## Cookiedata route/page
The cookiedata route is displayed with the /login route with the form data passed as parameters. It displays the cookie data and provides a form with a single button to allow the user to return to the home page.

As can be seen on the Chrome Development tools/Inspection page, you can see that the cookie was set to agree with the display.
